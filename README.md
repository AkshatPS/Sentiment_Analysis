# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

This is a fully functional Python project with a GUI using the Tkinter library. It inputs a YouTube video link and performs sentiment analysis on the comments using the DistilBERT model.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts comments from a given YouTube video.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the extracted comments for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes a pre-trained DistilBERT model for analyzing the sentiment of the comments.
- **Visualization**: Displays the type of comments on a YouTube video in the form of graphs.

## Libraries and Tools

- **GUI**: Tkinter
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face's Transformers library

## Skills Demonstrated

### Analytical Skills
- **Data Extraction**: Fetching comments from YouTube videos.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, removing special characters, and other preprocessing steps.
- **Data Manipulation**: Transforming data into a format suitable for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Using graphs to display the sentiment of the comments.

### Machine Learning
- **PyTorch**: Implementing the ML model for sentiment analysis.
- **Transformers**: Loading pretrained models and tokenization using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-comment-sentiment-analysis.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
      cd youtube-comment-sentiment-analysis
   
4. Install all the requirements and necessary libraries


Now first run the 'sentiment machine learning model.py' and train it on necessary data after data processing.
After the run the file 'sentiment_analysis_final_code.py' and paste the youtube video link.
